## Resolution-robust Large Mask Inpainting with Fourier Convolutions [1]<a name="1"></a>
You‚Äôve most certainly experienced this situation once: You take a great picture with your friend, and someone is photobombing behind you, ruining your future Instagram post. Well, that‚Äôs no longer an issue. Either it is a person or a trashcan you forgot to remove before taking your selfie that‚Äôs ruining your picture. This AI will just automatically remove the undesired object or person in the image and save your post. It‚Äôs just like a professional photoshop designer in your pocket, and with a simple click!

This task of removing part of an image and replacing it with what should appear behind has been tackled by many AI researchers for a long time. It is called image inpainting, and it‚Äôs extremely challenging...

## Stitch it in Time: GAN-Based Facial Editing of Real Videos [2]<a name="2"></a>
You've most certainly seen movies like the recent Captain Marvel or Gemini Man where Samuel L Jackson and Will Smith appeared to look like they were much younger. This requires hundreds if not thousands of hours of work from professionals manually editing the scenes he appeared in.
Instead, you could use a simple AI and do it within a few minutes. Indeed, many techniques allow you to add smiles, make you look younger or older, all automatically using AI-based algorithms. It is called AI-based face manipulations in videos and here's the current state-of-the-art in 2022!

## NeROIC: Neural Rendering of Objects from Online Image Collections [3]<a name="3"></a>
Neural Rendering. Neural Rendering is the ability to generate a photorealistic model in space just like this one, from pictures of the object, person, or scene of interest. In this case, you‚Äôd have a handful of pictures of this sculpture and ask the machine to understand what the object in these pictures should look like in space. You are basically asking a machine to understand physics and shapes out of images. This is quite easy for us since we only know the real world and depths, but it‚Äôs a whole other challenge for a machine that only sees pixels.
It‚Äôs great that the generated model looks accurate with realistic shapes, but what about how it blends in the new scene? And what if the lighting conditions vary in the pictures taken and the generated model looks different depending on the angle you look at it? This would automatically seem weird and unrealistic to us. These are the challenges Snapchat and the University of Southern California attacked in this new research.

## SpeechPainter: Text-conditioned Speech Inpainting [4]<a name="4"></a>
We‚Äôve seen image inpainting, which aims to remove an undesirable object from a picture. The machine learning-based techniques do not simply remove the objects, but they also understand the picture and fill the missing parts of the image with what the background should look like.
The recent advancements are incredible, just like the results, and this inpainting task can be quite useful for many applications like advertisements or improving your future Instagram post. We also covered an even more challenging task: video inpainting, where the same process is applied to videos to remove objects or people.

The challenge with videos comes with staying consistent from frame to frame without any buggy artifacts. But now, what happens if we correctly remove a person from a movie and the sound is still there, unchanged? Well, we may hear a ghost and ruin all our work.

This is where a task I never covered on my channel comes in: speech inpainting. You heard it right, researchers from Google just published a paper aiming at inpainting speech, and, as we will see, the results are quite impressive. Okay, we might rather hear than see the results, but you get the point. It can correct your grammar, pronunciation or even remove background noise. All things I definitely need to keep working on, or‚Ä¶ simply use their new model‚Ä¶ Listen to the examples in my video!

## Towards real-world blind face restoration with generative facial prior [5]<a name="5"></a>
Do you also have old pictures of yourself or close ones that didn‚Äôt age well or that you, or your parents, took before we could produce high-quality images? I do, and I felt like those memories were damaged forever. Boy, was I wrong!

This new and completely free AI model can fix most of your old pictures in a split second. It works well even with very low or high-quality inputs, which is typically quite the challenge.

This week‚Äôs paper called Towards Real-World Blind Face Restoration with Generative Facial Prior tackles the photo restoration task with outstanding results. What‚Äôs even cooler is that you can try it yourself and in your preferred way. They have open-sourced their code, created a demo and online applications for you to try right now. If the results you‚Äôve seen above aren‚Äôt convincing enough, just watch the video and let me know what you think in the comments, I know it will blow your mind!

## 4D-Net for Learned Multi-Modal Alignment [6]<a name="6"></a>
How do autonomous vehicles see?

You‚Äôve probably heard of¬†LiDAR sensors¬†or other weird cameras they are using. But how do they work, how can they see the world, and what do they see exactly compared to us? Understanding how they work is essential if we want to put them on the road, primarily if you work in the government or build the next regulations. But also as a client of these services.

We previously covered¬†how Tesla autopilot sees and works, but they are different from conventional autonomous vehicles. Tesla only uses cameras to understand the world, while most of them, like¬†Waymo, use regular cameras and 3D LiDAR sensors. These LiDAR sensors are pretty simple to understand: they won‚Äôt produce images like regular cameras but 3D¬†point clouds. LiDAR cameras measure the distance between objects, calculating the pulse laser‚Äôs traveling time that they project to the object.

Still, how can we efficiently combine this information and have the vehicle understand it? And what does the vehicle end up seeing? Only points everywhere? Is it enough for driving on our roads? We will look into this with a new research paper by Waymo and Google Research...

## Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding [7]<a name="7"></a>
As if taking a picture wasn‚Äôt a challenging enough technological prowess, we are now doing the opposite: modeling the world from pictures. I‚Äôve covered amazing AI-based models that could take images and turn them into high-quality scenes. A challenging task that consists of taking a few images in the 2-dimensional picture world to create how the object or person would look in the real world.

Take a few pictures and instantly have a realistic model to insert into your product. How cool is that?!

The results have dramatically improved upon the first model I covered in 2020, called NeRF. And this improvement isn‚Äôt only about the quality of the results. NVIDIA made it even better.

Not only that the quality is comparable, if not better, but it is more than 1'000 times faster with less than two years of research.

## Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents [8]<a name="8"></a>
Last year I shared DALL¬∑E, an amazing model by OpenAI capable of generating images from a text input with incredible results. Now is time for his big brother, DALL¬∑E 2. And you won‚Äôt believe the progress in a single year! DALL¬∑E 2 is not only better at generating photorealistic images from text. The results are four times the resolution!

As if it wasn‚Äôt already impressive enough, the recent model learned a new skill; image inpainting.

DALL¬∑E could generate images from text inputs.

DALL¬∑E 2 can do it better, but it doesn‚Äôt stop there. It can also edit those images and make them look even better! Or simply add a feature you want like some flamingos in the background.

Sounds interesting? Learn more in the video or read more below!

## MyStyle: A Personalized Generative Prior [9]<a name="9"></a>
This new model by Google Research and Tel-Aviv University is incredible. You can see it as a very, very powerful deepfake that can do anything. 

Take a hundred pictures of any person and you have its persona encoded to fix, edit or create any realistic picture you want.

This is both amazing and scary if you ask me, especially when you look at the results. Watch the video to see more results and understand how the model works!

## OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models [10]<a name="10"></a>
We‚Äôve all heard about GPT-3 and have somewhat of a clear idea of its capabilities. You‚Äôve most certainly seen some applications born strictly due to this model, some of which I covered in a¬†previous video¬†about the model. GPT-3 is a model developed by OpenAI that you can access through a paid API but have no access to the model itself.

What makes GPT-3 so strong is both its architecture and size. It has 175 billion parameters. Twice the amount of neurons we have in our brains! This immense network was pretty much trained on the whole internet to understand how we write, exchange, and understand text. This week, Meta has taken a big step forward for the community. They just released a model that is just as powerful, if not more and has completely open-sourced it.

## BlobGAN: Spatially Disentangled Scene Representations [11]<a name="11"></a>
BlobGAN allows for unreal manipulation of images, made super easily controlling simple blobs. All these small blobs represent an object, and you can move them around or make them bigger, smaller, or even remove them, and it will have the same effect on the object it represents in the image. This is so cool!

As the authors shared in their results, you can even create novel images by duplicating blobs, creating unseen images in the dataset [like a room with two ceiling fans](https://youtu.be/mnEzjpiA_4E)! Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I believe it is one of, if not the first, paper to make the modification of images as simple as moving blobs around and allowing for edits that were unseen in the training dataset.¬†

And you can actually play with this one compared to some companies we all know! They shared their code publicly and a Colab Demo you can try right away. Even more exciting is how BlobGAN works. Learn more in the video!

## A Generalist Agent [12]<a name="12"></a>
Gato from DeepMind was just published! It is a single transformer that can play Atari games, caption images, chat with people, control a real robotic arm, and more! Indeed, it is trained once and uses the same weights to achieve all those tasks. And as per Deepmind, this is not only a transformer but also an agent. This is what happens when you mix Transformers with progress on multi-task reinforcement learning agents.

Gato is a multi-modal agent. Meaning that it can create captions for images or answer questions as a chatbot. You‚Äôd say that GPT-3 can already do that, but Gato can do more‚Ä¶ The multi-modality comes from the fact that Gato can also play Atari games at the human level or even do real-world tasks like controlling robotic arms to move objects precisely. It understands words, images, and even physics...

## Photorealistic Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Deep Language Understanding [13]<a name="13"></a>
If you thought Dall-e 2 had great results, wait until you see what this new model from Google Brain can do. 

Dalle-e is amazing but often lacks realism, and this is what the team attacked with this new model called Imagen. 

They share a lot of results on their project page as well as a benchmark, which they introduced for comparing text-to-image models, where they clearly outperform Dall-E 2, and previous image generation approaches. Learn more in the video...

## Make-a-scene: Scene-based text-to-image generation with human priors [17]<a name="17"></a>
Make-A-Scene is not ‚Äújust another Dalle‚Äù. The goal of this new model isn‚Äôt to allow users to generate random images following text prompt as dalle does‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich is really cool‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut restricts the user control on the generations.

Instead, Meta wanted to push creative expression forward, merging this text-to-image trend with previous sketch-to-image models, leading to ‚ÄúMake-A-Scene‚Äù: a fantastic blend between text and sketch-conditioned image generation.

## High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models [19]<a name="19"></a>
What do all recent super powerful image models like¬†DALLE,¬†Imagen, or¬†Midjourney¬†have in common? Other than their high computing costs, huge training time, and shared hype, they are all based on the same mechanism: diffusion.
Diffusion models recently achieved state-of-the-art results for most image tasks including text-to-image with DALLE but many other image generation-related tasks too, like image inpainting, style transfer or image super-resolution.

## An Image is Worth One Word: Personalizing Text-to-Image Generation using Textual Inversion [21]<a name="21"></a>
Text-to-Image models like DALLE or stable diffusion are really cool and allow us to generate fantastic pictures with a simple text input. But would it be even cooler to give them a picture of you and ask it to turn it into a painting? Imagine being able to send any picture of an object, person, or even your cat, and ask the model to transform it into another style like turning yourself into a cyborg of into your preferred artistic style or adding it to a new scene.

Basically, how cool would it be to have a version of DALLE we can use to photoshop our pictures instead of having random generations? Having a personalized DALLE, while making it much more simple to control the generation as ‚Äúan image is worth a thousand words‚Äù. It would be like having a DALLE model that is just as personalized and addictive as the TikTok algorithm.

Well, this is what researchers from Tel Aviv University and NVIDIA worked on. They developed an approach for conditioning text-to-image models, like stable diffusion I covered last week, with a few images to represent any object or concept through the words you will send along your images. Transforming the object of your input images into whatever you want!

## Expanding Language-Image Pretrained Models for General Video Recognition [22]<a name="22"></a>
We‚Äôve seen AI generate text, then generate images and most recently even generate short videos, even though they still need work. The results are incredible when you think that no one is actually involved in the creation process of these pieces and it only has to be trained once to then be used by thousands of people like stable diffusion is. Still, do these models really understand what they are doing? Do they know what the picture or video they just produced really represents? What does such a model understand when it sees such a picture or, even more complex, a video?

## Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision [24]<a name="24"></a>
Have you ever dreamed of a good transcription tool that would accurately understand what you say and write it down? Not like the automatic YouTube translation tools‚Ä¶ I mean, they are good but far from perfect. Just try it out and turn the feature on for the video, and you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm talking about.

Luckily, OpenAI just released and open-sourced a pretty powerful AI model just for that: Whisper.

It understands stuff I can‚Äôt even comprehend, not being a native English speaker (listen in the video) and it works for language translation too!

## DreamFusion: Text-to-3D using 2D Diffusion [25]<a name="25"></a>
We‚Äôve seen models able to take a sentence and¬†generate images. Then, other¬†approaches to manipulate the generated images¬†by learning specific concepts like an object or particular style.

Last week Meta published the¬†Make-A-Video model¬†that I covered, which allows you to generate a short video also from a text sentence. The results aren‚Äôt perfect yet, but the progress we‚Äôve made in the field since last year is just incredible.

This week we make another step forward.

Here‚Äôs DreamFusion, a new Google Research model that can understand a sentence enough to generate a 3D model of it. You can see this as a¬†DALLE¬†or¬†Stable Diffusion¬†but in 3D.

## Imagic: Text-Based Real Image Editing with Diffusion Models [26]<a name="26"></a>
If you think the recent image generation models like¬†DALLE¬†or¬†Stable Diffusion¬†are cool, you just won‚Äôt believe how incredible this one is.
"This one" is Imagic. Imagic takes such a diffusion-based model able to take text and generate images out of it and adapts the model to edit the images. You can generate an image and then teach the model to edit it any way you want.
